<h1>MoOdalis Tango Theme for Moodle</h1>

<p>by <a href="http://www.sym.net"><em>sym.net</em></a>, Cologne</p>

<p>Version 0.9</p>

<p>The MoOdalis Tango Theme is a simple but clear design for Moodle. It provides a new icon set based on the <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project">Tango Desktop project</a>, a color scheme with several blue and green tones and a layout with a little more whitespace than the moodle standard layout.</p>

<p>sym.net provides the theme mainly to integrate Moodle not only technically but also visually with the Odalis Information Framework. This integration is called the "MoOdalis Learning Management Framework". MoOdalis provides tools and services that help to manage organisational and corporate learning activities around the course room. For more information see: <a href="http://www.moodalis.de">http://www.moodalis.de</a></p>

<p>Of course you can use the theme without using Odalis.</p>

<p>The icon library is a modified and extended version of the <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library">Tango icon library</a>. All Icons are based on 16x16-pixel-svg-files (svg = scalable vector graphics) allowing to combine and recombine elements of an icon. The final vector files have been converted to the gif format. File type icons have only been replaced partially.</p>

<p>The MoOdalis Tango Theme including the icons as well as the Tango base icon theme are public domain. Nevertheless the Tango team and sym.net would be grateful to be mentioned, whenever the theme is being used. You might use the following reference:</p>
